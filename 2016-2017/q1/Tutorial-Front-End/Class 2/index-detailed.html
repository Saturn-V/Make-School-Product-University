                <p>Ear Practice is an easy and effective way to practice identifying
                musical intervals. It's a great way to improve your ability and
                 appreciation of music. </p>

                <p>Using the Ear Practice app you can practice intervals anywhere you
                are, while also keeping track of your progress over time to measure
                your improvement. </p>

                <div class="how-to-header">
                    <h2>How to use the app</h2>
                </div>
                   
                <p>Select the intervals you want to practice. Then tap start to begin
             a practice session. </p>

                <p>For beginners start with three or four easy intervals like: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Major Third</li>
                    <li>Perfect Fifth</li>
                    <li>Octave</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When you can confidently identify these add a new interval to your
                 practice set. </p>
