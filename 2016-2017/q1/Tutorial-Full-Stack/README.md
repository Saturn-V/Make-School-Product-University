### Tutorial - Full-Stack Ruby on Rails 
1. Projects built to better understand Ruby
    * [Capitalizer](https://github.com/MrCodeCollector/Tutorial-Full-Stack/blob/master/Ruby/capitalize_script.rb): Capitalizes the first letter of every word inputed by a user.
    * I actually spent the week before making this script learning Ruby which is why this section is so empty. But worry not! I will find those scripts I made and add them here soon.
2. Projects built to better understand Ruby on Rails
    * [Bike Shop](https://github.com/MrCodeCollector/Tutorial-Full-Stack/tree/master/Rails/BikeShop): Built to understand the function of **routes**.
    * [Doggo](https://github.com/MrCodeCollector/Tutorial-Full-Stack/tree/master/Rails/Dogs): Built to understand the concept, function, and implementation of **routing** and **HTTP Requests**.
    * [Apartment List](https://github.com/MrCodeCollector/Tutorial-Full-Stack/tree/master/Rails/Rails%20Apps/apartment-list): Built to understand the concept and implementation of **route-side-in**.
    * [Wat](https://github.com/MrCodeCollector/Tutorial-Full-Stack/tree/master/Rails/users): I don't really remember what this one was for...will update soon.
3. Projects built ot better understand **TTD** (Test Driven Development)
    * [Translator](https://github.com/MrCodeCollector/Tutorial-Full-Stack/tree/master/Test%20Driven%20Development/TDD%20Translator): Translates an inputed sentence into another language; dependent on hashes that store pre and post translations of words. Also, don't confuse the "Migration" commit with a literal Rails Migration, I just have very bad commit names sometimes.
    * [Triangulator](https://github.com/MrCodeCollector/Tutorial-Full-Stack/tree/master/Test%20Driven%20Development/TDD%20Triangle): Find the area of any given triangle. TO be fair, it doesn't actually do just that, only because it's a lot of math and I just wanted to get on with learning some more rails because rails is cool. But I may someday implement calculating area for all given triangles **;D**.

##### That's about it. Thanks for sticking around. I'll update this readme with some fun GIF's and what not in the near future.
