# Make School: Product Academy
### Core - Accelerated IOS
1. Playgrounds used to better understand **Swift**
    * [Swift.Intro](https://github.com/MrCodeCollector/Perm-Accelerated-Swift/tree/master/Playgrounds/Swift.Introduction/Swift-Language.playground): 11 (12?) playgrounds covering everything Swift from structs, to type casting.
    * in order to see my progress you'd actually have to open this specific playground. I might not have gone through all of them due to familiarity with some of the concepts.
2. Applications built to better understand **Xcode** (I really hate Xcode and forever will)
    * [Tip Pro](https://github.com/MrCodeCollector/Perm-Accelerated-Swift/tree/master/TipPro): Built to understand the function of **auto-layout** (equally as annoying as Xcode I think).
    * [Make School Notes](https://github.com/MrCodeCollector/Perm-Accelerated-Swift/tree/master/MakeSchoolNotes-Swift-V2-Starter-swift3-coredata): Built to understand the concept, function, and implementation of **Core Data** and **some oher important stuff I can't remember the name of but recall how to use**.
    * [JSON](https://github.com/MrCodeCollector/Tutorial-Full-Stack/tree/master/Rails/Rails%20Apps/apartment-list): Work in progress; to understand how to use **API's** in xcode.
3. Applications built for fun
    * [Coming SoOoOoOon](): 

##### That's about it. Thanks for sticking around. I'll update this readme with some fun GIF's and what not in the near future.
